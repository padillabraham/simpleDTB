A simple database for random things.

Umm, I made a simple database?

======>INTRODUCTION

This is an unfinished database to practice SQL. There are some random tables and items in it.
If you want you cansteal it be advised that it's not even near complete.


=======>OBJECTIVE

The objective of this database is for me to familiarise myslef with SQL databases and create a 
professional one where I can store things that matter in them.

Database is free to take, just saying.

++++Version 0.0.1

I created two tables with a fews items in them. You are able to call simple things like the name and colour of
items also has recipies that can be selected with SQL queries. Pretty cool, huh? Anyways, no bugs have been
found maybe next time.
